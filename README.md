AirBnB is the famous website that is used by millions to get accomodatons fr their vacations worldwide. So me and my partner are doing a replica of it slowlty by slowly, with the purpose of fully accomplishing it. and since it's not the original we call ours hbnb.

This is a base of the project since it helps in brainstorming and implemetation of ideas. This means that the console isthe baseline where if you get an idea you can use it to see what it does if it is worth it then implement it in the whole system.
The console is built to work as the same as the famous shell, and used to visualize the idea and storage management.
